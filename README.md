For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a basic command line application using Node and Inquirer that could be used to manage employees, departments, and roles at a company. Currently, the application can view employees, roles, and departments, as well as add to them and update employee roles. Employees can be assigned managers and roles, roles can be given names, departments, and salaries, and departments can be given names. Every item in the database is tracked using a unique integer id used to associate it with other items where appropriate, such as employees with their roles/managers and roles with their respective departments. The code is structured to allow for it to be built upon in the future to add further functionality, like updating other aspects of the database.

This assignment gave me a lot of practice with using MySQL queries in JavaScript to interact with a SQL database. It also gave me a better handle on how to structure my JavaScript code to ensure specific functions were executed in the correct order, which is something that can still trip me up from time to time coming from languages like Java and Python.
